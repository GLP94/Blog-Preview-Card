Project featured in the Frontend Mentor site. The task was to recreate the proposed blog post preview, with assets and guides provided together with a replica done on Figma.

## Tools used

1. HTML
2. CSS

## What Was Learned

* Variables (`var`) are very useful, both to save time and keep the consistency of the document;
* It is better to use variable factors like `vh`, `vw`, or `rem` to make it so that everything resizes coherently with the screen size.

## What Needs Work

* The card kept breaking due to width improperly assigned. Still not sure when or how to properly set up the width through `max-width` or `min-width` to get the desired effect;
* I couldn't center the card cleanly. In the end, the solution was to set the width of the body with `vw` and the height with `vh`;
* I considered wrapping more things inside `div` containers, but I could not see any reason to do that, besides aligning them with flexbox;

## Afterwords

Any suggestions or criticisms are welcome!
